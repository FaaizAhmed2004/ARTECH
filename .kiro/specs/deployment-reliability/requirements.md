# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving deployment reliability and error handling for the Next.js e-commerce application. The current deployment process is experiencing unexpected build failures on Vercel, which impacts the ability to deploy updates and maintain the live application. This feature will implement robust error handling, build optimization, and deployment monitoring to ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable deployments that don't fail unexpectedly, so that I can confidently deploy updates to the live application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment is triggered THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully without unexpected errors
2. IF a build error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN build optimization is implemented THEN the deployment time SHALL be reduced by at least 20%
4. IF a deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive build monitoring and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a build starts THEN the system SHALL log all build steps with timestamps
2. IF an error occurs during build THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error context and stack traces
3. WHEN build metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track build duration, bundle sizes, and resource usage
4. IF build performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert developers with specific metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build configuration, so that builds are faster and more reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Next.js configuration is optimized THEN the build SHALL use efficient bundling strategies
2. IF static assets are processed THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching and compression
3. WHEN dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve potential conflicts
4. IF build size exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide bundle analysis and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment rollback capabilities, so that I can quickly recover from failed deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous working version
2. IF a rollback is triggered THEN the system SHALL restore the last known good deployment within 2 minutes
3. WHEN deployment history is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide a list of previous successful deployments
4. IF a deployment is marked as problematic THEN the system SHALL prevent automatic promotion to production

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-deployment validation, so that issues are caught before they cause deployment failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive pre-deployment checks
2. IF TypeScript errors exist THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN build artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL validate their integrity and completeness
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with specific configuration guidance
